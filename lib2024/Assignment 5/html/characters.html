                    <h3> Agathion </h3>
                        <p> <i> "A brave young, goblinesque person on a quest to save their younger sibling from The House. They set out on their quest with only their trusty hat and stick. They are accompanied by their pet bat, Batricia." </i> </p>

                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Class:</span> Hero<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Equipment:</span> Sticks, Hats<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Magic:</span> Illusions, Hexes, Hat-Based Magic<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Encountered:</span> Start of game<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Ultimate Item:</span> Ultima Stick
                        </p>

                        <p> Agathion is by far the most balanced party member, able to slot into several roles. Once they unlock Hat Based Magic they can comfortably fill the role of support or damage dealer, or they can equip The Heavy Stick to buff their defense and play the role of tank. Early in the game, it is recommended to rush to the Attic to find The Red Hat to buff Agathion's damage as this will make the first few levels much easier. </p>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3> Batricia </h3>
                    <p> <i> "A Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat) and Agathion's pet/best friend. Batricia is able to communicate telepathically with the other party members and wield various types of magic. Batricia is the party's voice of reason and does her best to keep Agathion on the right path." </i></p>

                    <p><span class="blue-text"> Class:</span> Bat<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Equipment:</span> Fangs, Bat Sweaters<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Magic:</span> Echolocation, Flight, Telepathy, Pyrokinesis, Good Advice<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Encountered:</span> Start of game<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Ultimate Item:</span> Grandma's Sweater
                    </p>

                    <p> Batricia is the best spellcaster in the party, able to learn more spells than any other character. While she has low defense, her high dodge stat makes her a viable tank in the early game. Prioritize teaching Batricia as many spells as possible and these will help with more difficult boss fights such as The Ghost Knight. Batricia can be equipped with different sweaters to make certain spells more effective. </p>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3> Brooce </h3>

                    <p> <i> "The crass ghost of a door-to-door suitcase salesman who yearns to escape from The House. Brooce joins the party in The Basement after making Agathion promise to help him escape The House. Some of his advice is suspect, but his knowledge of The House is invaluable." </i></p>

                    <p><span class="blue-text"> Class:</span> Dead<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Equipment:</span> Suitcases, Bedsheets<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Magic:</span> Necromancy, Hexes, Bad Advice<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Encountered:</span> The Basement<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Ultimate Item:</span> The Travelmaster Suitcase Model T-1000
                    </p>

                    <p> Brooce is the tankiest companion and possesses a mean physical attack. However, don't sleep on his magic as his access to Hexes and his unique Bad Advice spell school allow him to inflict useful debuffs throughout the game. If you complete the Crypt Beetle's sidequest in The Crypts, you will be rewarded with the Ethereal Bedsheet which greatly increases Brooce's dodge stat, further increasing his tankiness. </p>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3> The Domovoi </h3>

                    <p> <i> "A strange, blue, furry creature that Agathion meets in The Attic of The House. Its true motifs are impossible to discern, but it seems benign and follows Agathion on their quest. It seems to have a deep link to The House itself." </i></p>

                    <p><span class="blue-text"> Class:</span> Spirit<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Equipment:</span> Boots, Amulets<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Magic:</span> Healing, House Spells<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Encountered:</span> The Attic<br>
                    <span class="blue-text"> Ultimate Item:</span> Biggest Boots
                    </p>

                    <p> Upon first inspection, The Domovoi may seem like the weakest companion due to its relatively low stats. However, it is the only companion with access to healing magic and as such becomes invaluable in the late game. TAKE WARNING: The Domovoi is the only companion that you can miss. You MUST complete the houseplant's sidequest in The Attic to recruit The Domovoi. </p>
