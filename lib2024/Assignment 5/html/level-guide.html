I am going to set up some JavaScript so the bat animates when the mouse is hovering over it. Additionally, I'm using the onclick method here to switch between my pages. I learned this from Niyati Thakkar at Scaler Topics. -->

                        <h3> Level 1: The First Floor </h3>
                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Boss:</span> The Hunter Bug<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Enemies:</span> Bugs, Angry Ghosts, Brooms<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Treasure:</span> Pointy Stick, Warm Bat Sweater, Green Hat<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Side-Quests:</span> The Sad Ghost, Fixing the Piano<br>
                        <span class="blue-text"> Companions:</span> None
                        </p>

                        <p> It is recommended to recruit The Domovoi before engaging with The Hunter Bug which will pursue you throughout the level. It is possible to complete all of The Attic before finishing The First Floor. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3> Level 2: The Attic </h3>

                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Boss:</span> The Eyefoot<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Enemies:</span> Eyes, Foots<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Treasure:</span> Iron Fangs, Magic Boots, Red Hat, Heavy Stick, Strange Amulet<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Side-Quests:</span> The Houseplant<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Companions:</span> The Domovoi (CAN BE MISSED, unlocked after completing houseplant sidequest)
                            </p>
    
                            <p> Make sure you complete the houseplant sidequest to recruit The Domovoi as once The Eyefoot is defeated it can no longer join the party. There are many hidden passages in the Attic so be sure to investigate every statue and bookcase. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3> Level 3: The Basement </h3>

                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Boss:</span> The Recluse<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Enemies:</span> Spiders, Centipedes, Gremlins<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Treasure:</span> Golden Suitcase, Orange Hat, Deluxe Bat Sweater, Moldy Bedsheet<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Side-Quests:</span> Clean the Basement, Fix the Elevator<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Companions:</span> Brooce (can't be missed)
                            </p>
    
                            <p> You cannot enter The Basement until the first two levels are completed. Brooce is recruited in the first room. It is technically possible to tell him not to join the party, but this is not recommended as he will join automatically later anyways. The Clean the Basement sidequest only triggers if The Domovoi is in the party. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3> Level 4: The Crypts </h3>

                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Boss:</span> The Ghost Knight<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Enemies:</span> Ghouls, Tomb Mold, Angry Bones<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Treasure:</span> The Black Hat, Poison Fangs, Furry Boots, Ethereal Bedsheet<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Side-Quests:</span> The Crypt Beetle, Art Theft<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Companions:</span> None
                            </p>
    
                            <p> The Art Theft sidequest triggers as soon as the party enters The Crypts. It does not give any major rewards but does provide some interesting lore if completed. It is not recommended to face The Ghost Knight until you are well prepared, as he is considered the most difficult boss in the game. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3> Level 5: Far Beneath the Earth </h3>

                        <p><span class="blue-text"> Boss:</span> The Thing in the Dark<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Enemies:</span> Things That Go Bump in the Night, Lost Ones, Purple Worms<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Treasure:</span> Ultima Stick, Grandma's Sweater, Travelmaster Suitcase Model T-1000, Biggest Boots<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Side-Quests:</span> Help the Worm, Hinder the Worm<br>
                            <span class="blue-text"> Companions:</span> None
                            </p>
    
                            <p> All five of the party's ultimate items are hidden throughout the final level. It is recommended to gather all early on as the passage to the final boss is lengthy and contains strong enemies. Before progressing later into the level, the party meets The Worm and can choose to either help or work against them triggering the Help the Worm or Hinder the Worm sidequests. It is worth noting that if the player completes Hinder the Worm, they are locked out of the (arguable) best ending.
